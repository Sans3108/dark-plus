# Dark+
A simple recolor of the otherwise classic client. Makes everything darker. That's it.

Colors can be easily changed to fit your needs inside the theme file, be it even darker or lighter. _(why would you want this)_

The theme is light mode compatible. _(again, what is wrong with you)_

## Installation
- Go inside your themes folder (User settings > Themes > 3 dots > "Open themes folder").
- In the explorer window that pops up open a command prompt/powershell window and run this command:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Sans3108/dark-plus.git
  ```
