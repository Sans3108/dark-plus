# Dark+
A simple recolor of the otherwise classic client. Makes everything darker. The font has also been changed to [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito).

Colors can be easily changed to fit your needs inside the theme file, be it even darker or lighter. _(why would you want this)_

The theme is light mode compatible. _(again, what is wrong with you)_

_("compatible" here means: does not break light mode by making it dark, it doesn't make sense to make light mode be dark.)_

## Powercord Installation
- Go inside your themes folder (User settings > Themes > 3 dots > "Open themes folder").
- In the explorer window that pops up open a command prompt/powershell window and run this command:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Sans3108/dark-plus.git
  ```
### Other clients
Most other clients have not been tested, because I've never used them. One that I know has no issues is GooseMod (+ optionally Topaz)

#### GooseMod Installation
- Open User Settings
- Go to the `Custom CSS` tab
- Copy the contents of the [main css file](https://github.com/Sans3108/dark-plus/blob/master/fC7oUOUEEi4.css) in the editor

#### GooseMod + Topaz Installation
- Open User Settings
- Go to the `Themes` section inside the `Topaz` tab
- Copy and paste the URL of the repo in the text box

## Issues
I will try my best to keep this theme updated, however if you spot something broken or not darkened up, and it's not fixed within a day, please open an [issue](https://github.com/Sans3108/dark-plus/issues) and be as descriptive as you can. Thank you!
